# MI250-final-try-2

## About This Project

This project is a look into what it feels like to graduate college. For the first time, there isn't a "next logical step." What do I do now? Who am I? 

By creating a python project that lets me do whatever I want, I can pretend to have some control over my life. 

## How It Works

The game is an interactive choose-your-own-adventure where you play as a fresh Michigan State grad navigating life after graduation. Starting from East Lansing, you pick your own adventure through a series of choices that take you around the globe.

The user can select what they want to do from 3-4 options, until they are done traveling. The story includes over 60 locations across the world—from Vegas to Tokyo to Dublin—each with its own narrative flavor. After you quit, an attempt at what a map looks like is drawn showing everywhere you've been!

## Features

- **60+ Story Locations**: Travel from East Lansing to everywhere from Vegas to Seoul to the Irish countryside
- **Branching Narrative**: Every choice matters and affects where you go next
- **Interactive Map**: See your complete travel journey visualized on a world map using Python's Turtle graphics
- **Location Tracking**: Each destination stores real coordinates for accurate map plotting
- **No Wrong Choices**: Pick whatever sounds fun—there's no "bad ending," just your unique story

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Turtle graphics (usually built-in with Python)

### Running the Game

```bash
python main.py
```

Enter your name, then start making choices! Type a number (1-4) to pick your adventure, or type 'quit' anytime to end and see your map.

## Project Structure

- **main.py** - The main game loop and user interaction logic
- **travel_story.py** - All the story content, locations, and narrative paths
- **map_visualizer.py** - Turtle graphics code that draws your travel map

## The Map

I know the world map isn't perfect—the continents are simplified and the coordinates are approximated. But honestly, I promise I tried my best! The goal was to anchor the visualization rather than recreate an atlas.

## The Story

This whole thing is about graduating and having literally infinite choices (which is honestly kinda terrifying). You pick where to go, what job to take, whether to backpack Europe or stay close to home. The game celebrates the weirdness of post-grad freedom.

Hopefully you like my project!
